# Gitti

A fast, lightweight terminal UI for Git operations that keeps you in your flow.

> ⚠️ **Development Status**: Gitti is actively under development. Features, APIs, and behaviors may change significantly. Development is driven by personal needs first, with additional features planned afterward. Not all majority used Git operations are currently supported.

## Description

Gitti is a visual Git client built for developers who live in the terminal. It provides an intuitive TUI (Terminal User Interface) for common Git operations without the overhead of traditional GUI applications or the verbosity of CLI commands.

## Why Gitti?

Gitti is built for terminal-focused developers who need visual Git operations without breaking their flow. Traditional GUI clients like GitHub Desktop offer great interfaces but consume significant RAM and force context switching that disrupts your coding rhythm. Pure CLI commands are powerful but lack visual context for reviewing changes and managing branches. Born from personal need while working in Neovim, Gitti bridges this gap by bringing an intuitive, lightweight TUI directly into your terminal, no window management, no context switching, just seamless Git operations with visual clarity. Plus, it's universal with built-in support for English, Japanese, Simplified & Traditional Chinese.

### [v0.1.1]

- Context-based Process Management: Refactored Git operations to use context.Context for process cancellation and termination instead of manual process killing, providing cleaner and more reliable subprocess management

- Renamed/Copied File Handling: Added proper handling for renamed files (index state "R") in stage, unstage, and discard operations, and improved overall handling of copied and renamed files
- Git Stash Operations: Added output viewport and confirmation pop-ups for Git stash operations, with width adjustments for various TUI pop-ups
- Git Conflict Resolution: Introduced Git conflict detection and resolve options with enhanced thread-safety for streaming Git output to the UI. A new Keybinding for conflict resolution is added: `r` (resolve)
- Commit Output Control: Introduced InitialCommitStarted flag to control commit output viewport visibility and added viewport Y-offset adjustments for improved UI positioning
